# frontend2

A minimal Vite + React + Tailwind frontend that talks to the existing backend (assumes backend is served under `/api`).

Quick start:

1. cd frontend2
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:
- The app uses `/api` as the base for axios requests so run the backend on the same host/port or configure a proxy.
